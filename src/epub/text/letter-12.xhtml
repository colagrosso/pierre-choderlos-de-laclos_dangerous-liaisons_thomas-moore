			<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Madam,</p>
			<p>My Mamma is indisposed; she will not go out today, and I must keep her company: thus I am deprived the honour of attending you to the opera. I assure you I regret more the loss of your company than the performance. I hope you are persuaded of this, for I have a great affection for you. Be so good to tell the Chevalier Danceny, I have not yet got the collection which he mentioned, and that if he can bring it himself tomorrow, I shall be obliged to him. If he comes today, he will be told we are not at home; but the reason is, Mamma sees no company. I hope she will be better tomorrow.</p>
