			</hgroup>
			<p>The journal will inform you much better than I can, my dear friend, the melancholy state of our patient. Totally employed in my attendance on her, I have scarce time to write to you, as there are other matters to be attended to as well as her disorder. Here is a specimen of one which most certainly I did not in the least expect. I have received a letter from <abbr>M.</abbr> de Valmont, who has been pleased to choose me for a confidant, and even his mediatrix with Madame de Tourvel, to whom he wrote under my cover. I returned the one when I answered the other. I transmit you my answer; and I believe you will be of my opinion, that I neither could or ought to have anything to do with what he requests. Had I been even inclined to it, our unhappy friend was unable to understand me. Her frenzy is incessant. But what do you think of <abbr>M.</abbr> de Valmont’s distraction? Is it real, or does he mean to deceive the world to the last?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-33" id="noteref-33" epub:type="noteref">33</a></p>
			<p>If he is sincere this time, he may well say, he has made himself happy. I believe he will not be well pleased with my answer: but, I own, everything that fixes my attention on this unhappy adventure, raises my resentment more and more against the author of it.</p>
			<p>Adieu, my dear friend! I must return to my melancholy employment, which becomes more so, by the small prospect there is of success. I need not repeat my sentiments for you.</p>
