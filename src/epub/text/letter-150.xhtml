			</hgroup>
			<p>In expectation of the happiness of seeing you, I indulge myself, my tender friend, in the pleasure of writing to you; and thus by occupying myself with you, I dispel the gloom that otherwise would be occasioned by your absence. To delineate to you my sentiments, to recall yours to my mind, is a true enjoyment to my heart; and thus even the time of privation affords me a thousand ideas precious to my love⁠—Yet, if I am to believe you, I shall not obtain any answer from you, even this letter shall be the last, and we shall abandon a correspondence which, according to you, is dangerous, <em>and of which we have no need</em>⁠—Certainly I shall believe you if you persist; for what can you desire that does not of course become my desire? But before you ultimately decide upon it, will you not permit a slight conversation on the subject.</p>
			<p>Of the head of danger you are the only judge⁠—I can frame no calculation of it⁠—and I shall confine myself to requesting you would look to your own safety, for I can have no tranquillity while you are disquieted⁠—As to this object, it is not we two that are but one, it is thou that art us both.</p>
			<p>As to the matter of necessity, we can have but one thought; and if we differ in opinion, it can only rise from a want of proper explanation, or from not understanding one another. I shall therefore state to you what I think is my sensation.</p>
			<p>Without doubt a letter appears very unnecessary when we can see one another freely⁠—What could it say that a word, or look, or even silence itself, could not express? A hundred times before, this appeared to me so clear, that in the very moment that you spoke to me of not writing any more, that idea my mind immediately adopted⁠—It was a restraint upon it perhaps, but did not affect it⁠—Thus, when I have offered a kiss upon your bosom, and found a ribbon or piece of gauze in my way, I only turn it aside, and have not the least sentiment of an obstacle.</p>
			<p>But since we have separated, and you are no longer there, this idea of correspondence by letters has returned to torment me⁠—What is the reason, I have said to myself, of this additional privation? Why is it, because we are at some distance, we have nothing more to say to each other? Suppose that a fortunate concurrence of circumstances should bring us together for a day, shall we then employ in conversation the time that ought to be wholly dedicated to enjoyment, which letters between us would prevent? I say enjoyment, my dear friend; for with you the very moments of repose furnish, too, a delicious enjoyment; in a word, whenever such a happy opportunity offers, the conclusion is still separation; and one is so solitary, it is then a letter becomes truly precious: if not read, it is sure to be the only object that employs the eye. Ah! there can be no doubt, but one may look at a letter without reading it; as I think that I even could have some pleasure at night by barely touching your portrait.</p>
			<p>Your portrait have I said? but a letter is the portrait of the soul; it has not, like a cold image, that degree of stagnation so opposite to love; it yields to all our actions by turns; it becomes animated, gives us enjoyment, and sinks into repose⁠—All your sentiments are precious to me; and will you deprive me of the means of becoming possessed of them?</p>
			<p>Are you quite sure that a desire to write to me will never torment you? If in the midst of your solitude your heart should be too much compressed or desolated; if a joyous emotion should pass to your soul; if an involuntary sadness should disturb it for a moment, it would not then be in the bosom of your friend that you would pour out your happiness or distress; you would then have a sensation he should not share; and you would punish him to wander in solitude and distrust far from you. My friend, my dearest friend! you are to pronounce⁠—I have only proposed to myself to discuss the question with you, and not to overrule you⁠—I have only offered you reasons⁠—I dare hope I should have stood on stronger ground if I had proceeded to entreaties⁠—I shall endeavour, then, if you should persist, not to be afflicted; I shall use my efforts to tell myself what you would have wrote to me; but you would tell it better than I, and I should have a much higher gratification in hearing it from you.</p>
			<p>Adieu, my charming friend! The hour approaches at last, when I shall be able to see you: I fly from you with the more haste, in order the sooner to meet you again.</p>
