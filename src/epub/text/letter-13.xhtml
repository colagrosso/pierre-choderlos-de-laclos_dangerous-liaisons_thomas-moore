			</hgroup>
			<p>I am much concerned, my charming girl, to be deprived of the pleasure of seeing you, as well as for the cause; I hope we shall find another opportunity. I performed your commission with the Chevalier Danceny, who will certainly be very sorry to hear of your Mamma’s indisposition; if she’ll admit me tomorrow, I’ll wait on her. She and I will attack the Chevalier de Belleroche at piquet;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> and in winning his money, we shall have the double pleasure of hearing you sing with your amiable master, to whom I shall propose it. If it be agreeable to your Mamma and you, I will answer for my two Knights and myself. Adieu, my lovely girl! My compliments to Madame de Volanges. I embrace you most affectionately.</p>
