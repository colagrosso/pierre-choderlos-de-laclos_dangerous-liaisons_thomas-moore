			<p>It was not for want of time, that I did not answer your letter of the 19th, Viscount, but plainly because it put me out of temper, and did not contain a single syllable of common sense. I thought it then the best way to leave it in oblivion⁠—but since you seem fond of this production, and the sublime ideas it contains, that you construe my silence into consent, it is necessary you should have my opinion explicitly.</p>
			<p>I may have heretofore formed the design of singly performing the functions of a whole seraglio; but it never entered my head to become only a part of one; this I thought you knew, now, that you cannot plead ignorance, you may readily conceive how ridiculous your proposition must appear to me. Should I sacrifice an inclination, and a new one, for you? And in what manner, pray? Why, waiting for my turn, like a submissive slave, the sublime favours of your <em>highness</em>. When, for example, you was inclined to relax for a moment from <q>that unknown charm</q> that the <q>adorable, the celestial</q> <abbr>M.</abbr> de Tourvel only had made you feel;⁠—or when you dread to risk with the <em>engaging Cecilia</em>, the superior idea you wished her to preserve for you;⁠—then condescending to stoop to me, you will seek pleasures less violent, but of not much consequence, and your inestimable bounty, though scarce, must fill the measure of my felicity. Certainly you stand high in your own opinion; and my modesty nor my glass have yet prevailed on me to think I am sunk so low. This may be owing to my wrong way of thinking; but I beg you will be persuaded I have more imaginations of the same kind.</p>
			<p>One especially, which is, that <em>Danceny, the schoolboy, the whiner</em>, totally taken up with me, sacrificing, without making a merit of it, his first love, even before it was enjoyed, and loving me to that excess that is usual with those at his age, may contribute more to my happiness and pleasure than you⁠—I will even take the liberty to add, that if I had the inclination to give him a partner, it should not be you, at least now.</p>
			<p>Perhaps you’ll ask me why? Probably I should be at a loss for a reason; for the same whim that would give you the preference, might also exclude you. However, politeness requires I should inform you of my motive⁠—I think you must make too many sacrifices; and instead of being grateful, as you certainly would expect, I should be inclined to think you still owed me more⁠—You must therefore be sensible, our manner of thinking being so opposite, we can by no means unite: I fear it will be some time, nay a great while, before I change my opinion.</p>
			<p>When that happens, I promise to give you notice:⁠—Until then, let me advise you to take some other measures, and keep your kisses for those to whom they will be more agreeable.</p>
			<p>You say <q>adieu, as formerly!</q> but formerly, if I remember, you set a greater value on me than to appoint me entirely to the third characters; and was content to wait until I answered in the affirmative, before you was certain of my consent: don’t be angry then, if instead of saying adieu, as formerly, I say adieu, as at present.</p>
